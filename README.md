# Sanskrit RL Challenge

Inspired by this tweet (https://x.com/khoomeik/status/1925672343902240775), I have made some scripts for an RL environment for Sanskrit verb conjugation.

## Installation
See the requirements.txt file. 
The main requirement is the `vidyut` library (implemented in Rust, but it has Python bindings). 
You also need to download the Vidyut 4.0 data files, which I have already included in the repo for simplicity.
