# Problem Statement
"The Sanskrit literary corpus is huge and it often takes some sleuthing skill to identify which text a quote is from. Randomly sample quotes from across GRETIL, and reward based on how close (genre, book, chapter, verse) the LLM guesses. Does it become a better "librarian"/guide?"
